# hosts-list
A public hosts file for blocking known ads, trackers, and malware domains across the internet.

This is a personal hosts file to be used on any device that for any reason cannot have it's own hosts file manually
amended. Instead, with the aid of other third-party software, this hosts-file can be used to override the system's
default hosts file and point known ads, trackers, and malware domains to localhost so that the domains are never
resolved by the client device.
